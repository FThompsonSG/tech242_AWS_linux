# Monitoring and Alert Management

[Monitoring Diagram](<../README_images/Monitoring Diagram.pdf>)

- Monitoring is important as it will ensure a higher availability than without monitoring. Without monitoring if the CPU load is too high then the VM may/will fall over.
- By monitoring we can ensure that we have things in place to happen when a load threshold is broken such as and alarm or auto scaling.
- It is beneficial to turn on detailed monitoring as it provides second by second updates of metrics as opposed to every five minutes.
