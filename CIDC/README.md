# CIDC

## CI - Continuous Integration
It is a software development practice and a set of principles and techniques that involve automatically building, testing, and integrating code changes into a shared repository frequently, typically multiple times a day. The primary goal of CI is to detect and address integration issues early in the development process, promoting collaboration, quality, and rapid development cycles.

### Key Concepts
Version Control: Developers use a version control system (e.g., Git, SVN) to manage and track changes to the source code. The codebase is typically stored in a central repository.

Automated Build: CI systems automatically build the software from the latest codebase whenever changes are pushed to the repository. This ensures that the code can be successfully compiled.

Automated Testing: A suite of automated tests, including unit tests, integration tests, and possibly other types of tests, is run on the newly built code. These tests help identify bugs and regressions.

Immediate Feedback: If the build or tests fail, developers receive immediate feedback about the issues, allowing them to address them quickly.

Integration: Changes made by individual developers are continuously integrated into a shared codebase. This helps prevent "integration hell" where merging code becomes a complex and error-prone process.

## CD - Continuous Deployment
It is an extension of the CI process in software development that focuses on automating the deployment of code changes to production or other target environments after they have passed all tests and quality checks. It aims to make the release of new software versions or features a seamless and automated process, reducing manual intervention and minimizing the time between code changes and their availability to users.

### Key Concepts
Automated Deployment: The deployment process is automated, meaning that code changes can be deployed to production environments with little to no manual intervention.

Continuous Integration: CD builds upon the foundation of Continuous Integration (CI). Code changes are first integrated and tested in a controlled environment to ensure stability and correctness.

Automated Testing: Rigorous automated testing, including unit tests, integration tests, and possibly other types of tests (e.g., security tests, performance tests), is a crucial part of CD. Changes must pass these tests before deployment.

Monitoring and Feedback: Continuous monitoring of application and infrastructure health is essential. If issues arise after deployment, automated rollback or remediation processes may be triggered.

Feature Flags: Feature flags or toggles are often used to control the visibility and activation of new features in production. This allows for gradual feature rollouts and A/B testing.

Rollback Mechanisms: In the event of issues or regressions post-deployment, CD pipelines should have mechanisms for rolling back to a previous known-good state.

Immutable Infrastructure: CD often encourages the use of immutable infrastructure, where infrastructure changes are made by replacing entire instances or containers rather than modifying existing ones. This approach helps ensure consistency and reliability.

## CD vs CDE

### Continuous Deployment
CD is an approach in which every code change that passes automated testing and quality checks is automatically deployed to production or a production-like environment without manual intervention.
With CD, the goal is to make the deployment process completely automated and seamless, minimizing the time between code changes and their availability to end-users.
CD is often associated with the idea that code changes are continuously and automatically pushed to production, provided they meet the required criteria and pass all tests.
Continuous Delivery (CDE):

### Continuous Delivery
CDE is also an approach that automates the deployment process, but it includes an additional step compared to CD.
In CDE, code changes that pass automated testing and quality checks are automatically deployed to a staging or pre-production environment.
Unlike CD, where every change goes directly to production, CDE introduces a manual approval step before code changes are promoted from the staging environment to the production environment.
CDE is characterized by the ability to deliver changes to a production-like environment quickly, but the final decision to release those changes to production is made by a human operator or team.

## Jenkins
Jenkins is an open-source automation server commonly used for building, testing, and deploying software projects. It is a widely adopted tool in the field of Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) to automate various aspects of the software development lifecycle. Jenkins provides a flexible and extensible platform for automating repetitive tasks and integrating various tools and technologies.

### Key Features and Benefits
Automation: Jenkins allows developers to automate repetitive tasks such as building, testing, and deploying software. This automation helps improve efficiency and reduces the likelihood of manual errors.

Integration: Jenkins can integrate with a wide range of tools and technologies, including version control systems (e.g., Git, SVN), build tools (e.g., Maven, Gradle), testing frameworks, deployment platforms, and more.

Pipeline Support: Jenkins supports the creation of continuous delivery pipelines, where a series of automated steps (e.g., build, test, deploy) are defined and executed in a specific order. This enables end-to-end automation of the software delivery process.

Extensibility: Jenkins is highly extensible through plugins. Users can install and configure plugins to add new functionality or integrate with additional tools and services.

Wide Community and Plugin Ecosystem: Jenkins has a large and active community of users and contributors, resulting in a vast ecosystem of plugins and resources available to enhance its functionality.

Security: Jenkins provides security features such as role-based access control (RBAC), authentication, and authorization to control user access and permissions.

Monitoring and Reporting: Jenkins generates reports and provides insights into the status of builds, tests, and deployments, helping teams identify issues and trends.

Scalability: Jenkins can be scaled to meet the needs of both small and large organizations, making it suitable for projects of varying sizes and complexity.

Open Source: Jenkins is open-source software, which means it is freely available for anyone to use, modify, and distribute.

### Stages of Jenkins
In Jenkins, the stages of a build or deployment process are typically defined using pipelines, which allow you to automate and orchestrate a series of steps. These steps are organized into stages, and Jenkins provides a high degree of flexibility in defining and customizing these stages to match your specific workflow.
