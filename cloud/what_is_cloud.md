# Cloud

## A way to access and use computer resources over the internet, just like you might use a streaming service to watch movies or videos.

1. On-Demand Resources: Instead of buying and maintaining your own computers, you can use cloud computing services whenever you need them. It's like renting a car for a trip instead of owning one all the time.
2. Pay-as-You-Go: With cloud computing, you usually pay only for what you use. It's similar to paying for electricity: you pay based on how much you consume, rather than having to own and run your own power plant.
3. Scalability: Cloud services can grow or shrink with your needs. If your website or app becomes popular, you can easily get more computing power and storage from the cloud provider. This is like having a store that can instantly get bigger when more customers arrive.
4. Accessibility: You can access your cloud resources from anywhere with an internet connection. It's like having your files and software available on any device, whether it's your computer, smartphone, or tablet.
5. Managed Services: Cloud providers offer various tools and services, such as databases, machine learning, and security features. They handle the maintenance and updates, so you can focus on using these services without worrying about the technical details.
6. Reliability: Cloud providers often have multiple data centers in different locations, which means your data and applications are backed up and protected. This helps ensure that your services are available even if one data center has a problem.
7. Examples: Common cloud services include Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and services like Dropbox, Netflix, and Gmail, which use the cloud to store and deliver content and services.

## Different types/model of Cloud

- Public = External cloud providers deliver the resources as a fully managed service
- Private = A single organization uses a cloud service, either on site or via a third party
- Hybrid = Combination of onsite and cloud
- Multi = Combination of different cloud providers

## Different types of Cloud service

-	On-Premises = All physically onsite (more control but more responsibility)
-	IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) = Virtualisation, servers, storage and networking off site which provider manages.
-	PaaS (Platform as a Service) = We only provide the code (data and application), the provider provides hardware and software. Use cases: Web application development, API development, DevOps, and continuous integration.
-	SaaS (Software as a Service) = Data only on our side such as cloud streaming/gaming (e.g. save files). Popular SaaS applications include Gmail (email), Microsoft Office 365 (productivity suite), and Salesforce (customer relationship management).
